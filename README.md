### 👋🏻 Hey there! 

I'm Will, a passionate 4th-year student at the University of Toronto, working towards an Honours BSc with a double major in Statistics & Cognitive Science and a minor in Computer Science. I've spent 10 months as a research assistant in the Computer Systems & Networks Research Group, mentored by Prof. Eyal de Lara. Currently, I'm diving into the world of Neuroscience as a research assistant.

Leveraging my background in Statistics and Computer Science, I've built a strong foundation in data analysis, programming, and statistical modelling. My Cognitive Science education has enriched my understanding of human-centered design and the practical applications of technology.

🚀 My core interests include:

Virtual Reality
Healthcare Innovation
Machine Learning
Connect with me as I explore the intersection of technology and the human mind! 🧠✨
